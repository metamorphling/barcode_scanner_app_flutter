# Android Barcode Scanner Flutter

__Disclaimer: this is just a proof of concept project. In no way or form it could be used as is in production.__

## Introduction
Since Google ML Kit allowed for offline usage of pregenerated neural networks I got interested in seeing if I can make a simple barcode reading application. For that, I needed a wrapper to abstract ML Kit interface and provide an easy to use API to application.
This is an application part implemented in Flutter. I waned to see what was the Flutter hype all about.
Also, there was a chance of making this into commercial application, yet I lost interest during development. 
Dart is a drag and Flutter is pain in the ass to work with. Spaghetti by design is wrong even on idea level. Came to realisation that my free time is not worth it.

## Build
Library built with "Android Barcode Scanner Library" should be put into android/libs/app-*.aar
